1.  Introduction

   The Semantic Definition Format for Data and Interactions of Things
   (SDF, [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]) is a format for domain experts to use in
   the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the
   Internet of Things.

   SDF is an Interaction Modeling format, enabling a modeler to describe
   the digital interactions that a class of Things (devices) offers,
   including the abstract data types of messages used in these
   interactions.

   SDF is designed to be independent of specific ecosystems that specify
   conventions for performing these interactions, e.g., over Internet
   protocols or over ecosystem-specific protocol stacks.

   SDF does not define representation formats for the _Instance
   Information_ that is exchanged in, or the subject of such,
   interactions; this is left to the specific ecosystems, which tend to
   have rather different ways to represent this information.

   This document discusses types of Instance Information and will
   ultimately define Abstract (eco-system independent) Representation
   Formats for them as well as ways to use SDF Models to describe them.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The definitions of [RFC6690], [RFC8288], and [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf]
   apply.

   Terminology may need to be imported from [LAYERS].

   Representation:  As defined in Section 3.2 of RFC 9110 [STD97], but
      understood to analogously apply to other interaction styles than
      Representational State Transfer [REST] as well.

   Message:  A Representation that is exchanged in, or is the subject
      of, an Interaction.  Messages are "data in flight", not instance
      "data at rest" (the latter are called "Instance" and are modeled
      by the interaction model).

      Depending on the specific message, an abstract data model for the
      message may be provided by the sdfData definitions (or of
      declarations that look like these, such as sdfProperty) of an SDF
      model.

      Deriving an ecosystem specific representation of a message may be
      aided by _mapping files_ [I-D.bormann-asdf-sdf-mapping] that apply
      to the SDF model providing the abstract data model.

   Instantiation:  Instantiation is a process that takes a Model, some
      Context Information, and possibly information from a Device and
      creates an Instance.

   Instance:  Anything that can be interacted with based on the SDF
      model.  E.g., the Thing itself (device), a Digital Twin, an Asset
      Management system... Instances are modeled as "data at rest", not
      "data in flight" (the latter are called "Message" and actually
      are/have a Representation).  Instances that relate to a single
      Thing are bound together by some form of identity.  Instances
      become useful if they are "situated", i.e., with a physical or
      digital "address" that they can be found at and made the subject
      of an interaction.

   Proofshot:  A message that attempts to describe the state of an
      Instance at a particular moment (which may be part of the
      context).  We are not saying that the Proofshot _is_ the instance
      because there may be different ways to make one from an Instance
      (or to consume one in updating the state of the Instance), and
      because the proofshot, being a message, is not situated.

      Proofshots are snapshots, and they are "proofs" in the
      photographic sense, i.e., they may not be of perfect quality.  Not
      all state that is characteristic of an Instance may be included in
      a Proofshot (e.g., information about an active action that is not
      embedded in an action resource).  Proofshots may depend on
      additional context (such as the identity of the Instance and a
      Timestamp).

      An interaction affordance to obtain a Proofshot may not be
      provided by every Instance.  An Instance may provide separate
      Construction affordances instead of simply setting a Proofshot.

      Discuss Proofshots of a Thing (device) and of other components.

      Discuss concurrency problems with getting and setting Proofshots.

      Discuss Timestamps appropriate for Things (Section 4.4 of
      [I-D.ietf-iotops-7228bis], [I-D.amsuess-t2trg-raytime]).

   Construction:  Construction messages enable the creation of a digital
      Instance, e.g., initialization/commissioning of a device or
      creation of its digital twins.  They are like proofshots, in that
      they embody a state, however this state needs to be precise so the
      construction can actually happen.

      Discuss YANG config=true approach.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] (RFC2119) (RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terms we are trying not to use

   Non-affordance:  Originally a term for information that is the
      subject of interactions with other Instances than the Thing
      (called "offDevice" now), this term is now considered confusing as
      it would often just be an affordance of another Instance than the
      Thing.

2.  Instance Information and SDF

   Instantiation doesn't produce an instance (ouch), which is the
   device, twin, etc., but a message.

2.1.  Pre-structured types of messages

   Pre-structured types of messages are those that relate to an SDF
   model in a way that, together with context and model, they are fully
   self-describing.

2.1.1.  Input and output data of specific interactions

   Messages always have context, typically describing the "me" and the
   "you" of the interaction, the "now" and "here", allowing deictic
   statements ("the temperature here", "my current draw")...

   Messages may have to be complemented by this context for
   interpretation, i.e., the context needed may need to be reified in
   the message (compare the use of SenML "n").

   TODO: Use NIPC as an example how this could be used, including SCIM
   as a source of context information.

   TODO: explain how [RFC9039] could be used to obtain device names
   (using urn:dev:org in the example).

   (Describe how protocol bindings can be used to convert these messages
   to/from concrete serializations...)

2.1.1.1.  Examples for context information

   {
     "namespace": {
       "models": "https://example.com/models",
       "boats": "https://example.com/boats"
     },
     "defaultNamespace": "boats",
     "sdfInstance": {
       "$context": {
         "$comment": "Potential contents for the SDF context",
         "deviceName": "urn:dev:org:30810-boat007",
         "deviceEui64Address": "50:32:5F:FF:FE:E7:67:28",
         "scimObjectId": "8988be82-50dc-4249-bed2-60c9c8797677",
         "parentInstance": "TODO -- addressing instance in data tree"
       }
     }
   }

       Figure 1: Example for an SDF instance with context information

2.1.2.  Proofshots (read device, other component)

   (See defn above.)

   The following examples are based on Figure 2 of
   [I-D.lee-asdf-digital-twin-08], separated into an SDF proofshot and
   an SDF model.

   A proofshot that captures the state of a boat with a heater is shown
   in Figure 2.  Here, every property of the corresponding SDF model
   (see Figure 3) is mapped to a concrete value that corresponds with
   the associated schema information.  The alternating structure of the
   SDF model (e. g., sdfThing/boot007/sdfObject/heater/sdfProperty/
   isHeating) is repeated in the proofshot, with sdfObject and sdfThing
   being replaced by sdfInstance.

   While earlier approaches avoided the additional level of nesting by
   omitting the affordance quality names (i.e., sdfProperty, sdfAction,
   sdfEvent), including them explicitly avoids problems with namespace
   clashes and allows for a cleaner integration of meta data (via the
   $context keyword).

   As in any instance message, information from the model is not
   repeated but referenced via a pointer into the model tree
   (sdfInstanceOf); the namespace needed for this is set up in the usual
   namespace section that we also have in model files.

   Note that in this example, the proofshot also contains values for the
   implicit (offDevice) properties that are static (e.g., the physical
   location assigned to the instance) but are still part of the
   instance's proofshot as its location is fixed -- this boat apparently
   never leaves the harbor.

2.1.2.1.  Corresponding SDF Model

   Figure 3 shows a model like the one that could have been pointed to
   by the sdfInstanceOf pointers in the instance message.  Note how the
   namespace is managed here to export the model components into
   models:#/sdfThing/boat and models:#/sdfThing/boat/sdfObject/heater.

   (This example model only specifies structure; it also could come with
   semantic information such as the units that are used for wgs84 etc.
   In practice, the definition of wgs84 etc. probably would come from a
   common library and just be referenced via sdfRef.)

   Construction messages enable the creation of the digital instance,
   e.g., initialization/commissioning of a device or creation of its
   digital twins.  They are like proofshots, in that they embody a
   state, however this state needs to be precise so the construction can
   actually happen.

   A construction message for a temperature sensor might assign an
   identity and/or complement it by temporary identity information
   (e.g., an IP address); its processing might also generate
   construction output (e.g., a public key or an IP address if those are
   generated on device).

   Construction messages need to refer to some kind of constructor in
   order to be able to start the actual construction process.  It is
   still up for discussion whether this concept justifies a new keyword
   or whether construction and other lifecycle management processes
   should be modeled as sdfActions instead.

   (Note that it is not quite clear what a destructor would be for a
   physical instance -- apart from a scrap metal press, but according to
   RFC 8576 we would want to move a system to a re-usable initial state,
   which is pretty much a constructor.)

2.1.3.1.  Examples for SDF Constructors

   This section contains examples for both approaches discussed above:
   Figure 4 introduces an sdfConstructor keyword which allows for
   defining both mandatory (in this example: temperature and
   temperatureUnit) and optional constructor parameters (in this
   example, the ipAddress is optional).  The example shows that the
   names of constructor parameters may deviate from the quality names in
   the model (temperatureUnit vs unit) as the target quality is
   specified via a JSON pointer.  Additionally, this constructor example
   explicitly labels the ipAddress as information that belongs to the
   $context of the proofshot.

   The alternative approach is shown in TODO.  Here, the constructor is
   modeled as an sdfAction that contains the same set of parameters in
   its sdfInputData.

   (Add example here and discuss more pros and cons of the two formats.)

2.1.3.2.  Example for an SDF construction message

   Figure 5 shows a potential SDF construction message that allows for
   the creation of a proofshot from a constructor that is contained
   within an SDF model.

   Note that the ipAddress can be considered context information or an
   off-device property.  TODO: Needs more discussion how to model this
   kind of information.

2.1.4.  Deltas and Default/Base messages

   What changed since the last proofshot?

   What is different from the base status of the device?

   Can I get the same (equivalent, not identical) coffee I just ordered
   but with 10 % more milk?

   (Think merge-patch.)

   A construction message may be a delta, or it may have parameters that
   algorithmically influence the elements of state that one would find
   in a proofshot.

   Figure 6: Example for an SDF construction message for proofshot delta

   Deltas and Default/Base messages could be used in the Series Transfer
   Pattern [STP], which may be one way to model a telemetry stream from
   a device.

   A potential example for the use of proofshot deltas is shown in
   Figure 7.  Here, the proofshot delta refers to the previous example
   in Figure 2 via its proofshotId, which is included in the
   previousProofshot quality.  Compared to the previous proofshot, only
   the status property of the boat's heater has changed from error to
   operational.  Via an algorithm such as JSON Merge Patch [RFC7386],
   the actual proofshot can be resolved by applying the delta to the
   previous version.

   In future versions of this document, we will evaluate whether JSON
   Merge Patch is sufficient to fulfill the requirements for the
   resolution algorithm which have to formulated and refined themselves.

2.2.  Metadata

   One interesting piece of offDevice information is the model itself,
   including sdfinfo and the defaultnamespace.  This is of course not
   about the device or its twin (or even its asset management), because
   models and devices may want to associate freely.  Multiple models may
   apply to the same device (including but not only revisions of the
   models).

Appendix A.  Roads Not Taken

   This appendix documents previous modelling approaches that we
   eventually decided against pursuing further.  Its main purpose is to
   illustrate our development process, showing which kind of
   alternatives we considered before choosing a particular way to
   describe instance information.  We will remove this appendix as soon
   as this document is about to be finished.

A.1.  Using SDF Models as Proofshots

   As shown in Figure 8, the proofshot format could have also been
   modeled via SDF models where all sdfProperty definitions are given
   constvalues.  However, this concept is not capable of capturing
   actions and events.
