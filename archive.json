      "body": "This morning, I had the idea that could adapt the structure of the proofshot documents for designing an SDF way for the specification of protocol bindings.\n\nIn the examples below, you first find a simple SDF model:\n\n``` yaml\ninfo:\n  title: Example SDF Model that serves as a demonstration for a protocol binding.\nsdfObject:\n  smartlamp:\n    sdfProperty:\n      status:\n        description: Indicates whether the lamp is on or off.\n        type: boolean\n        writable: false\n      brightness:\n        description: Indicates the brightness of the lamp.\n        type: number\n        minimum: 0\n        maximum: 1000\n    sdfAction:\n      toggle:\n        description: Toggles the status of the lamp.\n```\n\nThat model is bound to CoAP resources via a protocol binding document (see below) that is quite similar to the proofshots we currently have defined in the instance-information draft (note the structure that replicates the one of the original SDF model as well as the `sdfBindingFor`).\n\n```yaml\ninfo:\n  title: A CoAP protocol binding example based on a smartlamp.\n  version: '2025-04-08'\n  copyright: Copyright 2025. All rights reserved.\nnamespace:\n  lamps: https://example.com/lamps\n  coap: https://example.com/coap-binding\ndefaultNamespace: lamps\nsdfInstance:\n  smartlamp:\n    sdfBindingFor: lamps:#/sdfObject/smartlamp\n    sdfProperty:\n      status:\n        readProperty:\n          - \"coap:href\": coaps://example.org/status\n            \"coap:method\": GET # Could also be assumed the default\n            \"coap:contentFormat\": 50\n        observeProperty:\n          - \"coap:href\": coaps://example.org/status\n            \"coap:method\": GET # Could also be assumed the default\n            \"coap:contentFormat\": 50\n      brightness:\n        readProperty:\n          - \"coap:href\": coaps://example.org/brightness\n            \"coap:method\": GET # Could also be assumed the default\n            \"coap:contentFormat\": 60\n        observeProperty:\n          - \"coap:href\": coaps://example.org/brightness\n            \"coap:method\": GET # Could also be assumed the default\n            \"coap:contentFormat\": 60\n        writeProperty:\n          - \"coap:href\": coaps://example.org/brightness\n            \"coap:method\": PUT # Could also be assumed the default\n            \"coap:contentFormat\": 60\n    sdfProperty:\n      toggle:\n        invokeAction:\n          - \"coap:href\": coaps://example.org/toggle\n            \"coap:method\": POST # Could also be assumed the default\n```\n\nCurrently, the binding only contains `href`s, `contentFormat`s as well as the CoAP method that is supposed to be used with the respective resource. As the actual bindings are defined within objects of JSON arrays, it is possible to define multiple bindings for the same affordance. We would need to discuss whether these arrays should be able to contain multiple bindings to different protocols, or one protocol binding document should only contain bindings to a single protocol, with the ability to compose multiple documents together.\n\nAlso note that we would need to discuss the \"operation types\" to which we want to map the different operations that are possible for each affordance type. The example above is currently heavily influenced by Web of Things when it comes to the `op` types, but needs to reworked in that regard. ",

      "body": "In the current revision of the draft, the way construction is supposed to be handled from an SDF perspective is still a blank spot that needs to be addressed going forward. One challenge in particular is the question of how we could integrate information relevant for the construction process into our now unified message format.\n\nI think one way of handling this would be deviating a bit from the idea of using the exact same structure for the status report and construction message archetypes. Instead, we could let the affordance entries in a construction message provide arguments for the constructor parameters defined in a model, would could lead to instance-related messages like the following:\n\n```yaml\ninfo:\n  messageId: 75532020-8f64-4daf-a241-fcb0b6dc4a42\nnamespace:\n  models: https://example.com/models\n  sensors: https://example.com/sensor\ndefaultNamespace: models\nsdfInstanceOf:\n  model: sensors:#/sdfObject/sensor\nsdfInstance:\n  sdfContext:\n    ipAddress: 192.168.1.5\n  sdfProperty:\n    temperature:\n      \"$comment\": This constructor argument sets the reported unit to Celsius\n      unit: Cel\n```\n\nIn this case, we could let an SDF model define that the temperature unit is be settable via a constructor parameter. In a state patch message, we could then refer to the same set of parameters to apply an update to the device and, for example, set the reported unit to Fahrenheit.\n\nHowever, I am wondering whether this mechanism would actually go against our principle of separating class-level from instance-related information, since applying the unit to the `sdfProperty` definition would effectively create a derivation of the base model. This would effectively hand over control from the base model to the newly created one, which does not feel exactly right to me.\n\nI am therefore asking myself whether we should treat configurable parameters as context information instead, by establishing a relationship between `sdfProperty` and `sdfContext` via something like the `contextMap` we already have in the draft. Then we could set the `unit` that is applicable to the `sdfProperty` `temperature` like so:\n\n```yaml\ninfo:\n  messageId: 75532020-8f64-4daf-a241-fcb0b6dc4a42\nnamespace:\n  models: https://example.com/models\n  sensors: https://example.com/sensor\ndefaultNamespace: models\nsdfInstanceOf:\n  model: sensors:#/sdfObject/sensor\nsdfInstance:\n  sdfContext:\n    ipAddress: 192.168.1.5\n    temperatureUnit: Cel\n```\n\nThe linking in the SDF model on the other hand could look like this:\n\n```yaml\nnamespace:\n  models: https://example.com/models\n  sensors: https://example.com/sensor\ndefaultNamespace: models\nsdfObject:\n  sensor:\n    sdfContext:\n      ipAddress:\n        type: string\n      unit:\n        type: string\n    sdfProperty:\n      temperature:\n        type: number\n        contextMap:\n          unit: \"#/sdfObject/sensor/sdfContext/unit\"\n```\n\nThis approach would have the advantage of having one model that fully controls all configurable parameters. In my opinion, it would also further justify having a separate `sdfContext` keyword, as only this information would be settable in a construction or state patch message.",

Solving this problem would also bring us close to what we are actually trying to achieve here. There are different kinds of purpose in life information, a temperature sensor, for example, might not really care what it is actually being used for, to make use of the information the sensor collects other devices need to know in which room the sensor measures temperature.\n\nThe message (format) itself might be orthogonal to the actual usage of the messages (and questions like access control). This could also be relevant for understanding the relationship with NIPC, which is using SCIM in a similar way. Perhaps we can learn a lot here for construction messages as well.\n\nState patches are stateful (by design) which implies the use of a protocol, but they may still be abstract enough to understand which changes are applied to the information at hand.\n\nProvenance might be added later to messages.

      "body": "I had to think about the \"litmus test\" again with regard to the identity manifest, and was wondering whether construction messages could act as a means to initialize properties that are read-only. I think this might be a better way to handle identity information, as that kind of information can probably be retrieved via application-layer protocols in many cases and is therefore not really part of the context. Similarly, patch messages could be a way to change the value of properties that are otherwise non-writable during reconfiguration.\r\n\r\nI think the situation with actions and events is probably different, although we could think about whether there are situations where you want to initialize a device with an action state, or an action or event history.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @JKRhb in https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/instance-information/pull/29#discussion_r2688522285_\r\n            ",

Similarly, patch messages could be a way to change the value of properties that are otherwise non-writable during reconfiguration.\n\nI think the situation with actions and events is probably different, although we could think about whether there are situations where you want to initialize a device with an action state, or an action or event history.
